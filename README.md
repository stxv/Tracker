A simple tracker that can be used to record exercises performed
The purpose of this project was to learn and practice Flask along with a database.

I created this because I wanted to have a program that tracked my own personal workouts because I'd always use the notes app on my phone to do this.

I started with creating the database where inputs could be stored and retrieved. Then with that, I began to create different functions that users could perform. Most of these functions required their own HTML page where they could do things such as add, view, delete, and update their data. I also learned a little Jinja syntax since it went along with the database.

I wanted to have a simple but efficient program to keep track of all my data. But the biggest problem I ran into involved was having multiple sets of data under a single ID. If this problem was resolved, each entry would've had multiple rows of data rather than just one.
