Add workout button on homepage is clicked and from the python file the add_workout() is accessed
We are now in the add.html part of the code and in the add_workout() part of the python file
Inputs are typed into the table and once submitted, is comitted to the database and we are taken back to the home page to see that the entry was created

But can I change it so that a button commits the data but doesnt immediately take us back to the homepage?
Would it be a function that is called when clicked similar to the submit button?
